# Translations

The language translations sentences must be done in French only :fr: (temporarily, due to internal process).

If you create a new sentence, please don't put a `qtlid`. Our translator does it ;)

If you edit a sentence, we have two cases:

* You change the meaning of the sentence, please remove the `qtlid`.
* You correct a spelling mistake in a french sentence, please keep the `qtlid`.
